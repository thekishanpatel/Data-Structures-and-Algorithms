Here is a Python Implementation of a quite simple but popular data-strucutre---the LinkedList. 
This implementation is DoublyLinked, which makes traversing it in either direction very easy. 
Inserting/Deleting at either ends is of O(1) time-complexity.
Printing in either direction is of O(n) time-complexty.
